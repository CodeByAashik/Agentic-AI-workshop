# **DAY 01** 

### **1. Mathematics prerequisites:** 
- vector
- matrix
- Statistics(data cleaning)

### **2. AI streams and co-relation**
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Deep learning:  *The detailed one*
- Domain Knowledge : *Knowledge about the field the AI is related to or expected to work in*

## **3. Generative AI**
- **Computer Vision :** Deeply rooted toward Audio and video
- **LLM :** Text generating AI model
    > *Why large???? -> Because it is trained on huge number of data*

## **4. Agentic AI**
- **What is it???**:-> LLM + memory and other elements making it self sufficient to generate the overall output!


### **4.1. Multi-agent Agentic AI**
- multiple tools working in coordination .

### **4.2. Hardware for AI model trainning**
- CPU
- GPU
- TPU (Tensor processing unit)

## **5. Algorithms**
### **5.1. Types of learning**
- **5.1.1.** Supervised Learning(Regression and classification)
  - trainer labels the data and supervises the machine exactly what the data is about for each label
  - WE teach the model about certain data and late the ai predicts after the pattern is recognized

- **5.1.2.** Unsupervised Learning (Clustering and accomodation)
- **5.1.3.** Reinforcement Learning 
  - Mistake grdai sikdai 
  - eg: Toddler learning how to walk 

## **6. Biasness**
### **6.1. Types of biasness:**
